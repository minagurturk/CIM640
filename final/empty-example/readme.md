Final Project Ideas


1. Animal Disco

An animal disco scene in a forest, adding the characters in 3d if I can export them from Illustrator. 
Different sounds and movements and interactions when you click different parts of the canvas.

2. Characters from Different Countries 
3D Characters from different countries wearing their cultural accessories. 
For example, saying hello in different languages as soon as you click. 

3. Breast Cancer / Health & Wealth Deck 
To bring awareness to breast cancer, 6 ads will be placed in different parts of the screen as playing cards. Informational videos and stories will appear when the user clicks on some of the cards in the deck.

For example, you may click the sign in a card and the story of a woman may be watched or heard.
